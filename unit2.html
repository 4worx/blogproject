        <p1 class="p1">
            I used the VS Code (Visual Studio), for coding my website.
            The contents are majorly based on HTML format, as most of the
            contents of the actual site are based on the HTML process.
            Besides, I also used CSS for styling, because it makes easier to
            the stylesheet on the CSS, then use it through the 'class=' process in the HTML. This way, it was much
            easier to make
            font styles and colours and the setups for the hyperlinks as well.
            Although the pages may contain different contents, the layout design through
            the CSS is all the same for all the pages.

        <h1>1.5 Copyright and other constraints affecting the website</h1>
        <br>
        <p1 class="p1">
            Copyright law, a right that gives the owner of the work the right to say how others may use or not use it.
            This allows the owner to have an easier to doing business with
            their work online. However someone copies the work without the
            owner's permission and used for it for different business dealings,
            then the owner can say they breached their copyright.

            The constraints it may contain for the website may vary.
            Because, if the website is used for a business purpose,
            then any contents used from other sources might require the
            permission of the owner of that source. However, there are
            times when contents from other sources may allow used for
            practice purposes and some may not. In case of this, when
            using trying to use content from other sources, make sure to
            check for the copyright sign.

        <h1>1.6 Issues that people with disabilities may face </h1>
        <br>
        <p1 class="p1">
            In case of people with disabilities, it may vary. For example: for people with a visual disability, the
            site may be processed to contain a high-resolution system. This allows the fonts to be clear without any
            colour issues, besides there is also another system called 'zoom-in, zoom-out', this would allow a user to
            zoom in to the contents they'd like to see or read, which would make the content much look bigger. Besides,
            there is web accessibility available for people with disabilities, which helps with colour blindness, vision
            loss, and physical disability. With the web accessibility, it allows people with disabilities to be able to
            use, visit and surf over a website.

        <h1>1.7 File types for website </h1>
        <br>
        <p1 class="p1">
            For websites, there are many kinds of files types available, specially for a highly enhanced website. The
            file type category includes files for the website and related to the websites. These all include design,
            enhancement and many more for web pages, web applications and files referenced for the website.

            <br>
            Common file types appropriate for websites are: HTML and
            CSS
            <br>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML: hypertext markup language, a text-based approach for coding that describes how the contents
                    within HTML file is designed and the markup tells a web-browser how to display the texts, images,
                    and other messages on the webpage.
                </li>
                <br>
