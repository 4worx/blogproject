        <br>
        <p1 class="p1">
                I used the VS Code (Visual Studio), for coding my website. 
                The contents are majorly based on HTML format, as most of the 
                contents of the actual site are based on the HTML process. 
                Besides, I also used CSS for styling, because it makes easier to 
                the stylesheet on the CSS, then use it through the 'class=' process in the HTML. This way, it was much easier to make
                font styles and colours and the setups for the hyperlinks as well. 
                Although the pages may contain different contents, the layout design through 
                the CSS is all the same for all the pages.

        <h1>1.5 Copyright and other constraints affecting the website</h1>
        <br>
        <p1 class="p1">
                Copyright law, a right that gives the owner of the work the right to say how others may use or not use it. 
                This allows the owner to have an easier to doing business with 
                their work online. However someone copies the work without the 
                owner's permission and used for it for different business dealings,
                 then the owner can say they breached their copyright.

                The constraints it may contain for the website may vary. 
                Because, if the website is used for a business purpose, 
                then any contents used from other sources might require the
                 permission of the owner of that source. However, there are 
                 times when contents from other sources may allow used for 
                 practice purposes and some may not. In case of this, when 
                 using trying to use content from other sources, make sure to 
                 check for the copyright sign.

        <h1>1.6 Issues that people with disabilities may face </h1>
        <br>
        <p1 class="p1">
                In case of people with disabilities, it may vary.
                 For example: for people with a visual disability, 
                 the site may be processed to contain a high-resolution 
                 system. This allows the fonts to be clear without any 
                 colour issue, besides there is also another system 
                 called 'zoom-in, zoom-out', this would allow zooming 
                 in to the contents they'd like to see or read, which 
                 would make the content to look bigger.
