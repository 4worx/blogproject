        <h1>1.1 Purpose of IT in Modern Business</h1>


        <p1 class="p1">The purpose of IT in modern businesses is that it improves both performance and the effectiveness
            of the products, systems and services. Businesses rely on IT for fast data processing, communication and
            networking. This allows a business to expand much more quickly and efficiently. Besides as it provides
            security for the business, it also became an essential part of every business plan. With the collaborative
            of IT, it allows businesses around the globe to work on different components simultaneously. This goes from
            innovations to microprocessing, then delivering to systems. All these are processed by IT and helps
            businesses to respond quickly and efficiently.

        <h1>1.2 Methods, skills, and resources needed to complete digital project</h1>

        <p1 class="p1">
            For a digital project, it is important to have some skills that are acquired through experiences and
            collaborations. Such as planning, resource management, time management and organising.
            As the project can be in any size or types, such as websites, apps, and other online varieties. Thus, the
            tools, skills, and methods it'd require can vary. But all of them would require a fixed deadline, time
            management, planning for the steps and organising the details of the progression.

        <h1>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT</h1>

        <p1 class="p1">
            The planning for the tasks would be done through the trello board, as it is easier and useful for making
            plans step by step. Since, the trello board contains steps for setting up 'to do, doing, and done' process,
            which allows a user to be more precise on which part they're working on for the tasks.
            <br>
            <br>
            So, once the plan setting has been done for the website in a step, for example making CSS for styling,
            adding contents within HTML and designing the layouts.
            <br>
            After all that has been, although there might be some extras need to be added later on. The contents of the
            plan will be carried out by Visual Studio Coding.

        <h1>1.4 Risks that impact the project</h1>

        <p1 class="p1">
            As the advancement of the use of internet access and online storage has increased, there are also a lot
            of
            risks that constantly happens throughout the network and servers.<br> This causes a small scale to large
            scale
            of impact to projects failing depending on the size of the actual project. <br>For example: even though
            my
            project might be a small one, but the risks it contains can be internet disconnection, trello board
            which
            contains my plan getting closed down or server overloaded, there's also computer system malfunctioning
            and
            much more which can cause the project to fail or deadline passed.
            <br>
            <br>

            Some of the risks that can make the project to fail are:<br>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>DoS attack on trello: which can cause trello to close down or overloaded.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Internet disconnection: unable to access online network and since the project is in the cloud
                    drive thus
                    without internet connection it'd unreachable.</li>
                <br>
                <li>System malfunction: computer system malfunctioning such as malware / virus attack.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Data loss: losing data throughout the cloud drive for the project. This can happen when the
                    storage server
                    receives a cyber attack.</li>
                <br>
            </ul>

        <h1>1.5 Selecting and using IT systems and software</h1>

        <p1 class="p1">
            To select the right kind of technology, you need to look at the kind of job/task/ work you'll have to do
            and
            the technology it'll require. For example: to complete and develop our current project, we will require
            HTML/CSS format with the new systems, now if either of the parts such as HTML/CSS or the system is more
            than
            a year or 2 years old. Then this might make it hard to complete the job. So to select the right kind of
            technology for the right job is important, this allows the job to be completed. Example of the system
            and software that'll be used for the project:<br>

        <h1>1.6 How the chosen technologies helped to achieve the outcomes</h1>

        <p1 class="p1">
            Trello is a web-based-list making application that uses the kanban system. This kanban system uses a
            method
            which consists of lists, board and card. This allows making a list of what to the process of it,
            which will
            be within a board as cards.

            Github is hosting for software development version control using Git. Github is the code hosting
            platform
            for version control one projects from anywhere. As Git and Github work together, Git is the assigned
            version
            control system for managing any changes to the source code history during software development.

        <h1>1.7 Legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</h1>

        <p1 class="p1">
            It is important to follow significant legislation and constraint when using software and other
            digital
            content for the project. As many of the digital contents and Softwares contain copyright and digital
            rights
            management for the restriction and besides when buying software for the project which will normally
            come
            with a license to use it that will contain the usability and restriction for the software.<br>
            <br>
            There are also GDPR (general data protection regulation), which applies for EU and EEA. The aim of
            it is to
            boost the rights that citizens of the EU/EEA have over their data that is held and processed by an
            organisation. this is to make sure that the people can have a greater capability over their data and
            make
            organisations more clear on how they'd deal with the sensitive information.
