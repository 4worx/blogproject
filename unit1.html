            <br>
            <p1 class="p1">The purpose of IT in modern businesses is that it improves both performance and the
                effectiveness of the
                products, systems and services. This allows a business to expand much more quickly and efficiently.
                Besides
                IT also provides security for the businesses as well.

                To make a project successful, it needs to be planned efficiently with organised ideas. Besides it also
                requires time management and a fixed deadline.
                The tools it'd require can vary. Such as internet accessibility, trello for designing plan. There's also
                the
                tool for HTML / CSS file development will be required.
                The skills it requires are a lot, such as knowing how to plan and making a plan,managing time and
                deadline,
                basic skills on HTML or CSS and much more.</p1>

                Using the trello board, the plan for developing the website and the completion of the whole course work
                makes it easier. Because, through the board, you're able to plan and decide which to do, done and
                completion
                steps of the whole project.<br>

            <h1>1.4 Risks that impact the project</h1>
            <br>
            <p1 class="p1">
                As the advancement of the use of internet access and online storage has increased, there are also a lot
                of
                risks that constantly happens throughout the network and servers.<br> This causes a small scale to large
                scale
                of impact to projects failing depending on the size of the actual project. <br>For example: even though
                my
                project might be a small one, but the risks it contains can be internet disconnection, trello board
                which
                contains my plan getting closed down or server overloaded, there's also computer system malfunctioning
                and
                much more which can cause the project to fail or deadline passed.
                <br>
                <br>

                Some of the risks that can make the project to fail are:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>DoS attack on trello: which can cause trello to close down or overloaded.</li>
                    <li>Internet disconnection: unable to access online network and since the project is in the cloud
                        drive thus
                        without internet connection it'd unreachable.</li>
                    <li>System malfunction: computer system malfunctioning such as malware / virus attack.</li>
                    <li>Data loss: losing data throughout the cloud drive for the project. This can happen when the
                        storage server
                        receives a cyber attack.</li>
                </ul>

            <h1>1.5 Selecting and using IT systems and software</h1>
            <br>
            <p1 class="p1">
                To select the right kind of technology, you need to look at the kind of job/task/ work you'll have to do
                and
                the technology it'll require. For example: to complete and develop our current project, we will require
                HTML/CSS format with the new systems, now if either of the parts such as HTML/CSS or the system is more
                than
                a year or 2 years old. Then this might make it hard to complete the job. So to select the right kind of
                technology for the right job is important, this allows the job to be completed. Example of the system
                and software that'll be used for the project:<br>

                It is important to follow significant legislation and constraint when using software and other
                digital
                content for the project. As many of the digital contents and Softwares contain copyright and digital
                rights
                management for the restriction and besides when buying software for the project which will normally
                come
                with a license to use it that will contain the usability and restriction for the software.<br>

                There are also GDPR (general data protection regulation), which applies for EU and EEA. The aim of
                it is to
                boost the rights that citizens of the EU/EEA have over their data that is held and processed by an
                organisation. this is to make sure that the people can have a greater capability over their data and
                make
                organisations more clear on how they'd deal with the sensitive information.
