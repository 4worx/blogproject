            <b>1.2 methods, skills, and resources needed to complete digital project</b> <br>
            <br><font size="5">
            To make a project successful, it needs to be planned efficiently with organised ideas. Besides it also
            requires time management and a fixed deadline.
            The tools it'd require can vary. Such as internet accessibility, trello for designing plan. There's also the
            tool for HTML / CSS file development will be required.
            The skills it requires are a lot, such as knowing how to plan and making a plan,managing time and deadline,
            basic skills on HTML or CSS and much more.</font>

            Using the trello board, the plan for developing the website and the completion of the whole course work
            makes it easier. Because, through the board, you're able to plan and decide which to do, done and completion
            steps of the whole project.<br>

            <b>1.4 risks that impact the project</b>
            <br><font size="5">
            As the advancement of the use of internet access and online storage has increased, there are also a lot of
            risks that constantly happens throughout the network and servers.<br> This causes a small scale to large scale
            of impact to projects failing depending on the size of the actual project. <br>For example: even though my
            project might be a small one, but the risks it contains can be internet disconnection, trello board which
            contains my plan getting closed down or server overloaded, there's also computer system malfunctioning and
            much more which can cause the project to fail or deadline passed.
            <br>
            <br>

            Some of the risks that can make the project to fail are:<br>
            <ul>
            <li>DoS attack on trello: which can cause trello to close down or overloaded.</li>
            <li>Internet disconnection: unable to access online network and since the project is in the cloud drive thus
            without internet connection it'd unreachable.</li>
            <li>System malfunction: computer system malfunctioning such as malware / virus attack.</li>
            <li>Data loss: losing data throughout the cloud drive for the project. This can happen when the storage server
            receives a cyber attack.</li></ul></font>

            <b>1.5 selecting and using IT systems and software</b>
            <br><font size="5"></font>
            To select the right kind of technology, you need to look at the kind of job/task/ work you'll have to do and
            the technology it'll require. For example: to complete and develop our current project, we will require
            HTML/CSS format with the new systems, now if either of the parts such as HTML/CSS or the system is more than
            a year or 2 years old. Then this might make it hard to complete the job. So to select the right kind of
            technology for the right job is important, this allows the job to be completed. Example of the system and
            software that'll be used for the project: pictures in here

            Github is hosting for software development version control using Git. Github is the code hosting platform
            for version control one projects from anywhere. As Git and Github work together, Git is the assigned version

            1.7 legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects
            It is important to follow significant legislation and constraint when using software and other digital
            content for the project. As many of the digital contents and Softwares contain copyright and digital rights
            management for the restriction and besides when buying software for the project which will normally come
            with a license to use it that will contain the usability and restriction for the software.

            There are also GDPR (general data protection regulation), which applies for EU and EEA. The aim of it is to
            boost the rights that citizens of the EU/EEA have over their data that is held and processed by an
            organisation. this is to make sure that the people can have a greater capability over their data and make
            organisations more clear on how they'd deal with the sensitive information.
