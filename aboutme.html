                I'm Nasim, a gamer but a not a professional one, even though would like to participate for a professional league, <br>
                which isn’t available in here. The reason I decided to come to codenation is to learn coding and cyber,<br>
                honestly, that’s how my thoughts are. An expert in coding could become an expert in cyber and through the cyber skills,
                later one that one can become a developer of their own game or someone who got lots of skills to tweak<br> around the games.
