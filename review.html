        <h1>2.1 Uses of IT tools and changes that are needed when
            making the site, are you comfortable with the tools you
            used!! </h1>
        <br>
        <p1 class="p1">The IT tools that are used for the web development are Visual Studio Code for developing the site
            with HTML / CSS and Trello for planning the development.
            However, some changes might be necessary for HTML / CSS link up, whereas sometimes style designed in CSS
            wouldn't show up with HTML how it needed to be.
            I'm comfortable with these tools, as they are slightly confusing but easier to use since everything is typed
            out. Specially for trello, which had already contained the step by step planning.

        <br>
        <h1>2.2 Whether the IT tools selected were appropriate </h1>
        <br>
        <p1 class="p1">Yes, they were. Especially Visual Studio Code, which made typing out the codes are easier. There
            were some confusion when some errors showed up, but since some guides available online for HTML / CSS coding
            and through these it was alright.</p1>

        <h1>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses for your final project </h1>
        <br>
        <p1 class="p1">The strength of final project could vary, although it wasn't hard but requires time, planning and
            format styles. But there are a lot of weaknesses, such as less enhancement (dynamic), simple background
            details and etc.</p1>

        <h1>2.4 Further improvements that could be made to the project </h1>
        <br>
        <p1 class="p1">
            Of-course further improvement could made to the project. For example: making it look dynamic. Having
            dropdown list for hyperlinks, putting up logo, more contents and details on the home page and even the
            background color could be changed to something much better. Especially the CSS, which could be detailed in
            further details.

        <br>
        <p1 class="p1">
            Yes they match the requirements and the objective of the assignment brief, but there might still be some
            more details that could be added to the outcomes.

        <h1>3.1 Benefit and drawback of the used tools and system </h1>
        <br>
        <p1 class="p1">
            There are a lot of benefits of the used tools and system, especially MacBook and Visual Studio code which
            are useful for the project. There's also trello which made it easier to draw out the plan and the steps for
            the project.

        <h1>3.2 Ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h1>
        <br>
        <p1 class="p1">The productivity and efficiency of the project could have been much better if there were more
            time for it. Since, it required steps to know it before working on it. Besides it could've been easier, if
            it were done as a team. After all imagine, doing this in a team of 3 or 4, the process could've been much
            easier and simpler, whereas one person doing planning and designing and then developing, at least wouldn't
            be as confusing as to when doing it alone.

        <h1>3.3 Solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital project
        </h1>
        <br>
        <p1 class="p1">
            Next time, I think it'd probably be easier to use 'Dreamweaver' for web development for the starters and
            later let getting to know of the use of Visual Studio Codings and learning how to develop web with it.
            Besides, it'd also be better to have a bit longer time for the deadline and also have a test review for the
            whole project rather than having reviews for every step. Because, rather than having some many reviews for
            every step of the development, I think it is better to simply have a test review for the whole project, this
            would help with the time management as well.

            3.4 How you would go about testing digital solutions
        </h1>
        <br>
        <p1 class="p1">
            Testing digital solutions aren't much of complex, as it only needs some steps of the solutions for the
            testing. In most of the cases, this is done through a testing table, where there are would be a list of
            solutions that need to be tested and with some options of improvements, changes, an adjustment that shows
            the testing was done or any changes were made.
